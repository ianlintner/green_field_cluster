# Azure AKS Deployment

This guide covers deploying Greenfield Cluster on Azure AKS with ARM Ampere Altra instances for optimal price/performance.

## Quick Start with Terraform

The fastest way to get started is using our [Terraform configuration](../../../infrastructure/azure/):

```bash
cd infrastructure/azure/
terraform init
terraform apply
```

See the complete [Azure Infrastructure Guide](../../../infrastructure/azure/README.md) for details.

## Manual Setup

Documentation coming soon for manual AKS setup...
