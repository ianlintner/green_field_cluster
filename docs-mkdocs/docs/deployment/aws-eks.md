# AWS EKS Deployment

This guide covers deploying Greenfield Cluster on Amazon EKS with ARM Graviton instances for optimal price/performance.

## Quick Start with Terraform

The fastest way to get started is using our [Terraform configuration](../../../infrastructure/aws/):

```bash
cd infrastructure/aws/
terraform init
terraform apply
```

See the complete [AWS Infrastructure Guide](../../../infrastructure/aws/README.md) for details.

## Manual Setup

Documentation coming soon for manual EKS setup...
