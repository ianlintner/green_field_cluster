# GCP GKE Deployment

This guide covers deploying Greenfield Cluster on Google GKE with ARM Tau T2A instances for optimal price/performance.

## Quick Start with Terraform

The fastest way to get started is using our [Terraform configuration](../../../infrastructure/gcp/):

```bash
cd infrastructure/gcp/
terraform init
terraform apply
```

See the complete [GCP Infrastructure Guide](../../../infrastructure/gcp/README.md) for details.

## Manual Setup

Documentation coming soon for manual GKE setup...
